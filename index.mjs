//. # Warped Components
//.
//. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wearereasonablepeople/warped-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wearereasonablepeople/warped-components)
//. [![Greenkeeper Enabled](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/wearereasonablepeople/warped-components.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
//.
//. An opinionated way to build frontend applications.
//. Works nicely with [Warped Reducers][1].
//.
//. ```console
//. $ npm install --save warped-components react xstream
//. ```
//.
//. ## In a nutshell
//.
//. - The view is handled by React.
//. - The state is handled by Redux.
//. - The effects are handled by Cycle with XStream.
//. - The wiring is handled by Warped Components.
//.
//. Warped Components does two things to facilitate your application:
//.
//. 1. It manages the creation of your Redux store, and uses [React Redux][5]
//.    to connect your components to the global state. But instead of taking
//.    `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions, it takes
//.    a `selectors` object whose values are functions that map the state to
//.    individual properties, and an `actions` object whose values are
//.    functions that given a payload, return a Redux Standard Action.
//. 1. It lets you associate your Cycle applications and Redux reducers with
//.    specific React components. Then, whenever React renders those
//.    components, Warped Components will update the global Redux reducer to
//.    contain only the reducers found in the tree, and it will shut down and
//.    start up the appropriate Cycle applications based on which are present
//.    in the tree. All of this is achieved by using [React Collect][2].
//.
//. This approach has the following benefits:
//.
//. 1. An architectural benefit, where all the logic related to a component,
//.    including asynchronous side-effects and state transformations, are all
//.    kept in a single place. This means that most changes to the application
//.    will be centred around a single directory in your source code.
//. 1. If you use code-splitting and multiple entry points, this approach
//.    facilitates a smaller main bundle, because the reducers and effects for
//.    components outside of the initial render tree don't have to be included.
//. 1. Your Redux reducers and Cycle applications are "hot by design". This
//.    means that if you use `module.hot`, your reducer logic and side-effect
//.    logic is also automatically hot-reloaded (given that you don't remount
//.    the WarpedApp, but only its children).

//. ## API
//.
//. ### Automatic wiring
//.
//# warped :: WarpedOptions -> ReactComponent -> ReactComponent
//.
//. Does zero to two distinct things to a component, depending on the options:
//.
//. - Connects it to the state using the given selectors and actions.
//. - Associates a Redux reducer and a Cycle application with the component.
//.
//. The options (all optional, though at least one should be provided) are:
//.
//. * `selectors`: An object whose keys correspond to properties, and values
//.   are functions that receive the state and return the value for the
//.   property.
//. * `actions`: A hash-map of action creators. The underlying component will
//.   receive them as props, and when called, the resulting action is
//.   dispatched to the store.
//. * `reducer`: A Redux reducer - a function which takes a state and an
//.   action, and returns a new state. Warped Components makes sure that
//.   whenever the connected component is mounted, this reducer will act as
//.   part of the reducers of your store.
//. * `effects`: A Cycle application - a function which takes a mapping of
//.   stream / stream-producers, and returns a mapping of streams.
//.
//. If you would just like the reducer or effects to be mounted without a
//. "view", for example when a reducer is in change of handling some state
//. shared between multiple components, then pass `null` as the ReactComponent.
//. The returned ReactComponent can still be rendered anywhere in the tree to
//. have its reducer and/or effects be mounted.
//.
//. For the definition of `actions` and `reducer`, we recommend using
//. [Warped Reducers][1], and for the definition of the selectors, we highly
//. recommend using an Optics library like [Ramda][3]'s `lens` related
//. functions or [partial.lenses][4].
//.
//. ```js
//. import {warped} from 'warped-components';
//. import {createReducer, noopAction} from 'warped-reducers';
//. import {lensProp, compose, set, view} from 'ramda';
//. import React from 'react';
//.
//. // We use a lens to describe our slice of the global state.
//. // How you do it is up to you, though.
//. export const dataState = compose (
//.   lensProp ('app'),
//.   lensProp ('data')
//. );
//.
//. // We use warped-reducers to create our reducer and actions.
//. export const {types, actions, reducer} = createReducer ('App') ({
//.   loadData: noopAction,
//.   setData: set (dataState)
//. });
//.
//. // A small Cycle app describes the side-effects of our component.
//. export const effects = ({action, http}) => ({
//.   http: action.filter (({type}) => type === types.loadData).mapTo ({
//.     url: 'https://api.github.com/users/Avaq',
//.     category: types.loadData
//.   }),
//.   action: http.select (types.loadData).flatten ().map (({body: {name}}) =>
//.     actions.setData (name)
//.   )
//. });
//.
//. // The selectors are used to map the global state to component props.
//. export const selectors = {
//.   data: view (dataState)
//. };
//.
//. // This is our view.
//. export const App = ({data, loadData}) => (
//.   <div>
//.     <h1>{data || 'name unknown'}</h1>
//.     <button onClick={loadData}>Load!</button>
//.   </div>
//. );
//.
//. // Warped Components wires the view to all of the above.
//. export default warped ({reducer, effects, selectors, actions}) (App);
//. ```
export function warped(def) {
  var connector = (def.selectors || def.actions) ?
                  (connect (compileSelectors (def.selectors || {}),
                            compileDispatchers (def.actions || {}))) :

//# WarpedApp :: ReactComponent
//.
//. This component does the wiring for your application:
//.
//. * Setting up your Redux store, and swapping out its `reducer` as needed.
//. * Setting up your Cycle application, and swapping out its `main` as needed.
//. * Linking the Redux Store and Cycle apps by adding two drivers:
//.     1. `state`: A read-only driver exposing a memory stream of the latest
//.        Redux state.
//.     2. `action`: A read-write driver exposing a stream of dispatched
//.        actions and allowing other actions to be dispatched.
//.
//. It takes the following optional props:
//.
//. * `initialState`: Some initial state for your store.
//. * `enhancer`: Store enhancer, allows middleware, debug tooling, etcetera.
//. * `drivers`: Cycle drivers determine what kind of effects can occur.
//.
//. ```js

//. import React from 'react';
//. import App from './my-app';
//.
//. const drivers = {http: makeHTTPDriver ()};
//.
//. render (
//.   <WarpedApp enhancer={devToolsEnhancer ()} drivers={drivers}>
//.     <App />
//.   </WarpedApp>,
//.   document.getElementById ('app')
//. );

//. ### Redux Utilities
//.
//. If you prefer using [React Redux][5] and [Redux][6] directly, rather than
//. using the [`WarpedApp`](#WarpedApp), you can use these utilities to ease
//. the interaction with [Warped Reducers][1].
//.
//# compileSelectors :: StrMap ((a, b) -> c) -> (a, b) -> StrMap c
//.
//. Given a mapping of selectors, returns a `mapStateToProps` function, as
//. accepted by `connect` from React Redux.
//.
//. The selectors are given the state (and previous props), and are expected
//. to return a slice of the state. We recommend using Optics, such as the
//. `lens`-related functions from [Ramda][2], to create the selectors.
export function compileSelectors(selectors) {
  return function mapStateToProps(state, prevProps) {
    var props = Object.create (null);
    Object.entries (selectors).forEach (function(entry) {
      props[entry[0]] = entry[1] (state, prevProps);
    });
    return props;
  };
}

//# compileDispatchers :: StrMap (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> StrMap (a -> c)
//.
//. Given a mapping of action creators, as returned from
//. [createReducer](#createReducer), returns a `mapDispatchToProps` function,
//. as accepted by `connect` from React Redux.
export function compileDispatchers(actions) {
  return function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
    var props = Object.create (null);
    Object.entries (actions).forEach (function(entry) {
      props[entry[0]] = function dispatchAction(payload) {
        return dispatch (entry[1] (payload));
      };
    });
    return props;
  };
}

//# combineReducers :: Array ((a, b) -> a) -> (a, b) -> a
//.
//. Given an array of reducers, returns a single reducer which transforms the
//. state by calling all reducers in sequence.
export function combineReducers(reducers) {
  return function rootReducer(rootState, action) {
    return reducers.reduce (function reduceReducers(state, reducer) {
      return reducer (state, action);
    }, rootState);
  };
}

//. ### Cycle utilities
//.
//# combineCycles :: Array (StrMap Any -> StrMap Stream) -> StrMap Any -> StrMap Stream
//.
//. Given an array of `main` functions that take sources and return sinks,
//. returns a single `main` function which combines the effects of each.
export function combineCycles(mains) {
  return function main(sources) {
    return mains.map (thrush (sources)).reduce (function(prevSinks, sink) {
      var combined = Object.assign ({}, prevSinks);

        combined[driver] = (combined[driver]) ?
                           (Stream.merge (combined[driver], sink[driver])) :

      });
